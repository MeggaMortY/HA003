# Browser_3D_Shaders

A 3D browser environment that simulates a few different shading techniques. [Demo link](https://computer-graphics-shaders.herokuapp.com/)

- Uses [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) to render 3D environments
- Written in JavaScript

## How to use
- Use the [Demo Link](https://computer-graphics-shaders.herokuapp.com/) or import  into an IDE and load into the browser locally 
- Switch shaders from the dropdown menu
- Magnitude corresponds to the strength of the shader
- lightX/Y/Z will move the light source in the X/Y/Z dimension

## Notes
- THREE.js is a JavaScript 3D-rendering library, so the entirety of the implementation can be found in `index.html`
- This is one of my earlier projects, before I read anything on Clean Code.
